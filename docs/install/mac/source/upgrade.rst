Upgrading
=========

This section describes how to upgrade from a previous **major** version of OpenGeo Suite.

If performing a **minor** upgrade, you may proceed with a typical :ref:`install <installation.mac.install>`. 

.. note:: A "major" version upgrade is from version 3.x to 4.y. A "minor" version upgrade is from 4.x to 4.y.

.. warning:: This upgrade is **not-backward compatible**. Irreversible changes are made to the data so that they can't be used with versions 3.x and below of OpenGeo Suite.

Back up PostGIS databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of the upgrade process is to back up your existing PostGIS data. 

#. Ensure the old (3.x) version of OpenGeo Suite is running.
 
#. Open up a terminal and Make sure that the PostgreSQL ``bin`` directory is on your path. By default, this is located at :file:`/opt/opengeo/pgsql/9.1/bin`. Use the command ``psql --version`` to verify:

   .. code-block:: console
 
      export PATH=$PATH:/opt/opengeo/pgsql/9.1/bin
      psql --version 

#. To backup, a specialized PostGIS upgrade utility is used. `Download this utility <http://repo.opengeo.org/suite/releases/pgupgrade/postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip>`_, and extract the archive to a temporary directory. To avoid permissions issues, it is best to put this directory on your desktop or in your home directory. By default, the backup files created from using this script will be saved into this directory.

   .. code-block:: console

      mkdir -p opengeo_backup/pg_backup; cd opengeo_backup/pg_backup
      curl -O http://repo.opengeo.org/suite/releases/pgupgrade/postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip
      unzip postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip

#. Run the backup command:

   .. code-block:: console

      perl postgis_upgrade.pl backup --port 5432 

   .. note:: For more information about supported options run ``perl postgis_upgrade.pl --help``. 

#. The script will run and create a number of files:

   * Compressed dump files for every database backed up (:file:`<database>.dmp`)
   * SQL output of server roles

#. The PostGIS data backup process is complete. You may now shut down OpenGeo Suite 3.x.

Install new Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now install the new version of OpenGeo Suite. See :ref:`installation.mac.install` for details. In order to run the PostGIS restore script you must install the :guilabel:`OpenGeo Client Tools` package.

Restore PostGIS databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Ensure ``PostGIS.app`` is running.

#. Ensure the PostGIS/PostgreSQL command line tools are on the PATH. If you did not install the :guilabel:`OpenGeo Client Tools`` package in the previous section do so now. From a command prompt, type the command: 

    .. code-block:: console
 
       export PATH=/usr/local/opengeo/bin:$PATH

#. Restore your PostGIS data by running the upgrade utility again with the "restore" argument:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd opengeo_backup/pg_backup
      perl postgis_upgrade.pl restore 

#. Your databases and roles will be restored. You can verify that the databases were created and data restored by running ``psql -l`` on the command line.

Restore GeoServer data directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Quit ``GeoServer.app``. 

#. Restore the GeoServer data directory:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/GeoServer
      mv data_dir data_dir.old
      cp -R ~/Library/Containers/com.boundlessgeo.geoserver/Data/Library/Application\ Support/GeoServer .

#. Restart ``GeoServer.app``. 

Uninstall old version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now uninstall the previous version of OpenGeo Suite. The uninstaller is located at :file:`/Applications/OpenGeo/OpenGeo Suite Uninstaller.app`.
