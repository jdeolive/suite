Upgrading on Ubuntu Linux
=========================

This section describes how to upgrade from a previous **major** version of OpenGeo Suite.

If performing a **minor** upgrade, you may proceed with a typical :ref:`install <installation.ubuntu.install>`. 

.. note:: A "major" version upgrade is from version 3.x to 4.y. A "minor" version upgrade is from 4.x to 4.y.

.. warning:: This upgrade is **not-backward compatible**. Irreversible changes are made to the data so that they can't be used with versions 3.x and below of OpenGeo Suite.

Back up PostGIS databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The commands in this section require root privileges. 

The first step of the upgrade process is to back up your existing PostGIS data. 

#. Change to the ``root`` user:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo su - 

#. Ensure PostgreSQL is running.

   .. code-block:: bash

      service postgresql start

#. Change to the ``postgres`` user:

   .. code-block:: bash

      su - postgres

#. To backup a PostGIS upgrade utility is used. `Download <http://repo.opengeo.org/suite/releases/pgupgrade/postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip>`_  the archive and extract it to a temporary directory. By default, the backup files created from using this script will be saved into this same directory:

   .. code-block:: console

      mkdir /tmp/opengeo_backup/pg_backup
      cd /tmp/opengeo_backup/pg_backup
      wget http://repo.opengeo.org/suite/releases/pgupgrade/postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip
      unzip postgis_upgrade-4.0.zip

   .. warning:: The :file:`/tmp` directory is not recommended for long term backups, as it can often be purged as part of normal system activity.

#. Run the backup command:

   .. code-block:: console

      perl postgis_upgrade.pl backup 

   .. note:: For more information about supported options run ``perl postgis_upgrade.pl --help``. 

#. The script will run and create a number of files:

   * Compressed dump files for every database backed up (:file:`<database>.dmp`)
   * SQL output of server roles

#. Exit back to the ``root`` user:

   .. code-block:: bash

      exit

#. The PostGIS data backup process is complete. 

Back up GeoServer data directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to back up the GeoServer data directory, located at :file:`/usr/share/opengeo-suite-data/geoserver_data`. 

#. Shutdown the Tomcat service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      service tomcat6 stop

#. Copy the old data directory to :file:`/tmp`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cp -r /usr/share/opengeo-suite-data/geoserver_data /tmp/opengeo_backup

Uninstall old Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now uninstall the old version of OpenGeo Suite. Do this by uninstalling the ``opengeo-geoserver`` and ``opengeo-postgis`` packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      apt-get remove opengeo-geoserver opengeo-postgis

Install new Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may now install the new version of OpenGeo Suite. See :ref:`installation.ubuntu.install` for details.

Restore PostGIS databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Ensure PostgreSQL is running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      service postgresql start

#. Change to the ``postgres`` user:

    .. code-block:: console
 
       su - postgres

#. Restore your PostGIS data by running the upgrade utility again with the "restore" argument:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd /tmp/opengeo_backup/pg_backup
      perl postgis_upgrade.pl restore 

#. Your databases and roles will be restored. You can verify that the databases were created and data restored by running ``psql -l`` on the command line.

Restore GeoServer data directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default GeoServer data directory location for OpenGeo Suite 4.x is located at :file:`/var/lib/opengeo/geoserver`. 

#. Stop the Tomcat service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      service tomcat6 stop

#. Rename the new default data directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mv /var/lib/opengeo/geoserver /var/lib/opengeo/geoserver.old

#. Restore the original data directory:

   .. code-block:: console

      cp -r /tmp/opengeo_backup/geoserver_data /var/lib/opengeo/geoserver

#. Ensure proper permissions on the restored copy:

   .. code-block:: console

      chown -R tomcat6 /var/lib/opengeo/geoserver

#. Start the Tomcat service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      service tomcat6 start
