Working with OpenGeo Suite for Windows
======================================

This document contains information about various tasks specific to OpenGeo Suite for Windows.

.. todo:: Might want to make the PG version a global var.

Starting and stopping OpenGeo services
--------------------------------------

OpenGeo Suite is comprised of two services:

#. **OpenGeo Jetty** - The `Jetty <http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/>`_ web server that contains all the OpenGeo web applications such as GeoServer, GeoWebCache, and GeoExplorer. 

#. **OpenGeo PostgreSQL** - The `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database server with the PostGIS spatial extensions. 

The services can be started and stopped directly from the Start Menu by navigating to :menuselection:`All Programs --> OpenGeo Suite` and using the :guilabel:`Start` and :guilabel:`Stop` short cuts. They must be run with Adminstrator rights.

      Starting and stopping OpenGeo services

Services can also be controlled from the Windows :guilabel:`Services` dialog available by navigating to :menuselection:`Administrative Tools --> Services` from the Windows :guilabel:`Control Panel`.

Service port configuration
--------------------------

The Jetty and PostgreSQL services run on ports **8080** and **5432** respectively. These ports can often conflict with existing services on the systemk, in which case the ports must be changed. 

Changing the Jetty port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the Jetty port:

#. Open the file :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Boundless\\OpenGeo\\jetty\\start.ini` in a text editor such as Notepad.

   .. note:: If you're running Windows 64 bit, the path will be :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Boundless\\OpenGeo\\jetty\\start.ini`.

#. Edit the property named ``jetty.port`` near the top of the file changing its value from ``8080`` to a number that that does not conflict with any existing services on the machine. 

.. note:: It is a common convention for Java services like Jetty to use port values greater than 8000. 

#. Optionally, change the ``STOP.PORT`` property in the same manner.

#. Restart OpenGeo Jetty service.

Changing the PostgreSQL port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the PostgreSQL port:

#. Open the file :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Boundless\\OpenGeo\\pgsql\\postgresql.conf` in a text editor such as Notepad.

#. Search or the ``port`` property (around line 63), uncomment it and change its value from ``5432`` to a number that does not conflict with any existing services on the machine.

#. Restart OpenGeo PostgreSQL service.

GeoServer Data Directory
------------------------

The **GeoServer Data Directory** is the location on the file system where GeoServer stores all of its configuration, and (optionally) file-based data. By default, this directory is located at :file:`C:\\ProgramData\\Boundless\\OpenGeo\\geoserver`.

To point GeoServer to an alternate location:

#. Create a new **System** environment variable named ``GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR``.
#. Set the value to the desired directory.

      Setting GeoServer Data Directory  

#. Restart the OpenGeo Jetty service.

.. note:: You may have to restart Windows itself for the environment variable change to be picked up.

PostgreSQL Configuration
------------------------

PostgreSQL configuration is controlled within the ``postgresql.conf`` file. This
file is located at:

|postgresql.conf|

.. note:: The :file:`ProgramData` directory is hidden, so it will not display in standard directory listings.
