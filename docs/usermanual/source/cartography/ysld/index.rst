Web map styling with YSLD
=========================

YSLD is the styling language used for maps created with Boundless Suite Composer. It is equivalent in functionality to Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD), a serialization markup language used internally by GeoServer, while providing a much simpler markup. In fact, YSLD runs directly on the same GeoServer engine, and is not "converted" into SLD prior to use.

This section will discuss using YSLD in Boundless Suite.
