We recommend using the shared folder as a way of transferring files between your host and your virtual machine, but not as a permanent storage location.

To load a file on your host system into GeoServer:

#. Copy the file to your shared folder on your host system.

#. Open a terminal to the virtual machine.

#. Verify that the file is there on your virtual machine: 

   .. code-block:: console

      cd /media/sf_share
      ls -l

   .. note:: If you don't see this directory, check that your shared folder settings are correct and that you copied the file to the correct location.

#. Copy or move the file out of the shared folder to a location on your virtual machine.

   .. code-block:: console

      cp /media/sf_share/data.zip /opt/data/data.zip

#. Make sure that the Tomcat service user (``tomcat8``) has access to the file:

   .. code-block:: console

      chown tomcat8:tomcat8 /opt/data/data.zip      

#. Now launch the :ref:`GeoServer Layer Importer <dataadmin.importer>` by logging in to the GeoServer admin interface and clicking :guilabel:`Import Data`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Browse` to select the file.

      Importing a file into GeoServer

#. Select the file and :ref:`continue with the import <dataadmin.importer>`.
