Most interaction with Boundless Suite will be done through a browser, but occasionally we will want to run commands directly on the virtual machine. To do this, we will use a terminal client.

.. note:: Use :guilabel:`Headless Start` to prevent the virtual machine console from even being shown.

We will use the following connection parameters to connect to the virtual machine via the terminal:

* **Host name**: ``localhost``
* **Port**: ``2020``
* **User**: ``root``
* **Password**: ``boundless123``

**Linux and OS X** systems have a built-in terminal utility with the ability to run SSH commands.

#. Enter the following command on a terminal:

   .. code-block:: console

      ssh -p 2020 root@localhost

#. The first time connecting to the virtual machine will fail (as the "ECDSA key fingerprint" used for a secure connection is not trusted). Enter :kbd:`yes` to add ``localhost:2020`` to the listed of known hosts.

#. When asked for a user name, enter :kbd:`root` and press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. When asked for a password, enter :kbd:`boundless123` and press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. Check the shared directory to confirm that files can be shared between the host and the virtual machine:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd /media/sf_share
      ls -l

   You should see the contents of your shared directory.

.. note:: If you named your shared directory something other than "share", the shared folder will be named :file:`/media/sf_<name>`.
