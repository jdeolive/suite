These instructions provide a **virtual machine** which has been already configured with Boundless Suite, eliminating the need to install Boundless Suite directly on your machine.

**All interaction with Boundless Suite will still be done through your host's standard browser or a terminal connection.** There is no need to interact directly with the virtual machine console once it is running.

These instructions should only be used with `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__. This machine has VirtualBox Guest Additions installed, which is required for functionality such as shared folders.
