Some Geoserver extensions require non-java (binary) support libraries.  

GDAL
~~~~

#. Install, from the Boundless Repository, the GDAL and GDAL-java packages.

   On Red Hat:

   .. code-block:: bash

      yum install gdal gdal-java

   On Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      apt-get install libgdal libgdal-java 

   .. note:: You can also install the :file:`gdal-mrsid` package for MrSID and JP2K support.

#. Verify the GDAL install by running :file:`gdalinfo --formats` to see a long list of supported formats and :file:`gdalinfo --version` to verify the version (1.11.2).  Also verify that the :file:`gdal.jar` file is in :file:`/usr/share/java`

#. Copy the :file:`gdal.jar` from :file:`/usr/share/java` into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your Geoserver web application.

#. Copy the :file:`.jar` files from the :file:`gdal` directory inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip` - available from Boundless Connect) into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your Geoserver web application.

#. In your Tomcat config, make sure that :guilabel:`-Djava.library.path` includes the gdal and gdal-jni libaries - :file:`/usr/lib64`,  :file:`/usr/lib`, :file:`/usr/lib/jni`.

#. In your Tomcat config (:file:`tomcat8.conf`), create a :guilabel:`GDAL_DATA` environment variable that points to :file:`/usr/share/gdal`

Also see :ref:`dataadmin.mrsid`.

NetCDF-4 Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Uninstalling the NetCDF-out extension requires editing the :file:`global.xml` file - see :ref:`dataadmin.netcdf.uninstall`

#. Install the NetCDF-output extension by copying the :file:`.jar` files from the :file:`netcdf-out` directory inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip` - available from Boundless Connect) into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your Geoserver web application. 

#. Install, from the Boundless Repository, the NetCDF package.

   On Red Hat:

   .. code-block:: bash

      yum install netcdf

   On Ubuntu:

   .. code-block:: bash

      apt-get install netcdf-bin

#. Verify the NetCDF install by running :file:`ncdump` to verify the version (4.3.3.1)

#. In your Tomcat config, make sure that :guilabel:`-Djna.library.path` includes the NetCDF libaries - :file:`/usr/lib64`,  :file:`/usr/lib`.
