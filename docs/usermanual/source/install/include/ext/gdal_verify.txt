To verify that the GDAL native library extension has been installed properly:

#. Navigate to the GeoServer web application and login using the admin credentials.

#. Navigate to the GeoServer Detailed Status Page at http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest/about/status.

#. Verify that the GDAL extension is available (:guilabel:`Enabled` and :guilabel:`Available` both set to :guilabel:`true`):

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/gdal_rest.png

      GDAL available

   If you don't see this exactly as displayed, the extension did not install correctly.

#. Click :guilabel:`Stores` then :guilabel:`Add new store`.

#. In the list of :guilabel:`Raster Data Stores`, you should see extra raster formats, such as :guilabel:`MrSID`, :guilabel:`EHdr`, and :guilabel:`NITF`.
