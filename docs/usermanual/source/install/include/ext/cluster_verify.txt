To verify that the extension has been installed properly:

#. Log in to the GeoServer web interface.

#. You should see a status line about a cluster node:

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/cluster_status.png

      Clustering status

   If you don't see this, the extension did not install correctly.
