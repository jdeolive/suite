To verify that the extension has been installed properly:

#. Log in to the GeoServer web interface.

#. Click :guilabel:`Stores` then :guilabel:`Add new store`.

#. In the list of :guilabel:`Vector Data Stores`, you should see an entry for :guilabel:`GeoPackage`.

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/geopackage_vectorstorelink.png

      GeoPackage in the list of vector stores

   In the list of :guilabel:`Raster Data Stores`, you should see an entry for :guilabel:`GeoPackage`.

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/geopackage_rasterstorelink.png

      GeoPackage in the list of raster stores

  If you don't see either of these entries, the extension did not install correctly.
