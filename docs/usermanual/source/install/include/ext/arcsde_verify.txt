To verify that the extension has been installed properly:

#. Log in to the GeoServer web interface.

#. Click :guilabel:`Stores` then :guilabel:`Add new store`.

#. In the list of :guilabel:`Vector Data Stores`, you should see :guilabel:`ArcSDE` in the list:

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/arcsde_storelink.png

      ArcSDE in the list of vector stores

   If you don't see this entry, the extension itself did not install correctly.
