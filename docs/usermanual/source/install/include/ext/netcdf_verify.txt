To verify that the **data store** extension has been installed properly:

#. Log in to the GeoServer web interface.

#. Click :guilabel:`Stores` then :guilabel:`Add new store`.

#. In the list of :guilabel:`Raster Data Stores`, you should see an entry for :guilabel:`NetCDF`.

   .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/netcdf_storelink.png

      NetCDF in the list of raster stores

   If you don't see this entry, the extension did not install correctly.
