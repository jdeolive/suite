To install :ref:`GeoPackage <intro.extensions.geopackage>` support in GeoServer, you will need to copy some files to the proper location. The files to be copied are inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip`).

#. Inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle, navigate to the :file:`geopackage` directory.

#. Copy the contents of the :file:`geopackage` directory into the library directory (:file:`WEB-INF\\lib`) of your GeoServer instance. For example, if your GeoServer application is located at :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Tomcat\\webapps\\geoserver`, copy the files to :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Tomcat\\webapps\\geoserver\\WEB-INF\\lib`.

#. Restart the server.

   .. note:: The GeoPackage extension adds the WPS extension. If WPS is not desired, you will want to manually turn the service off.
