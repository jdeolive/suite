To verify that the extension has been installed properly:

#. Open your GeoServer data directory.

   .. note:: If unsure of the location of the GeoServer data directory, log in to the GeoServer web interface and click :guilabel:`Server Status`. The location of the :guilabel:`Data directory` will be displayed at the top.

#. There should be a directory called :file:`scripts` created. This is where scripts can be created.

   If you don't see this directory or these files, the extension did not install correctly.
