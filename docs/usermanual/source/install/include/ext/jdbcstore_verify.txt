To verify that the extension has been installed properly:

#. Open your GeoServer data directory.

   .. note:: If unsure of the location of the GeoServer data directory, log in to the GeoServer web interface and click :guilabel:`Server Status`. The location of the :guilabel:`Data directory` will be displayed at the top.

#. Open the file :file:`logs/geoserver.log`. The last two lines should look similar to::

      2016-09-12 22:05:19,315 INFO [geoserver.jdbcloader] - JDBCConfig using JDBC DataSource Optional.of(jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/gsdata)
      2016-09-12 22:05:19,560 INFO [jdbcstore.internal] - Initializing Resource Store Database.

   If this is not the case, the extension did not install correctly.
