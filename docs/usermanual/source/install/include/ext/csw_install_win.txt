To install :ref:`CSW <intro.extensions.csw>` support in GeoServer, you will need to copy some files to the proper location. The files to be copied are inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip`).

#. Inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle, navigate to the :file:`csw` directory.

#. Copy the contents of the :file:`csw` directory into the library directory (:file:`WEB-INF\\lib`) of your GeoServer instance. For example, if your GeoServer application is located at :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Tomcat\\webapps\\geoserver`, copy the files to :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Tomcat\\webapps\\geoserver\\WEB-INF\\lib`.

#. Restart the server.
