To output specifically in NetCDF 4 format, you must install the NetCDF output format extension and *also the native NetCDF library*. The instructions for the latter are below.

#. In the extensions bundle, navigate to the :file:`windows` directory.

#. Run the :file:`netCDF4.4.1-NC4-32.exe` installer, making sure to select :guilabel:`Add netCDF to the system PATH for all users`, but accepting all other defaults

  .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/netcd4_path_win.png

#. Open a :guilabel:`Command Prompt` and type :guilabel:`ncdump`. You should see the following output:

#. Use :menuselection:`Start --> Apache Tomcat --> Configure Tomcat` to open :guilabel:`Apache Tomcat Properties`. Switch to the :guilabel:`Java` tab.

#. Under :guilabel:`Java Options`, add the following line (changing the path to your installation as necessary)::

   -Djna.library.path=C:\Program Files (x86)\netCDF 4.4.1\bin
  
  .. figure:: /install/include/ext/img/ncdf4-config-win.png
   
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply`.
     
#. Stop and start the server.
