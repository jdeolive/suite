To install :ref:`Clustering <sysadmin.clustering>` support in GeoServer, you will need to copy some files to the proper location. The files to be copied are inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle (:file:`BoundlessSuite-ext.zip`).

.. note:: The Clustering extension requires JDBCConfig to be installed and enabled. Refer to the instructions further down this page for installing these extensions before proceeding.

#. Inside the Boundless Suite extensions bundle, navigate to the :file:`cluster` directory.

#. Copy the contents of the :file:`cluster` directory into the library directory (:file:`WEB-INF/lib`) of your GeoServer instance. For example, if your GeoServer application is located at :file:`/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/geoserver`, copy the files to :file:`/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib`.

#. Restart the server.
