Creating application plugins
============================

This tutorial will show how to add additional functionality in the form of **plugins** to applications built using the :ref:`Boundless SDK <webapps.sdk>` GXP template. Plugins (also known as tools) can have actions and/or output. An action refers to a button or a menu item, while an output refers to something visible on the screen like a pop-up window or a panel.

Three examples will be shown:

* Plugin with an action
* Plugin with an output
* Plugin with a combination of action and output

These examples illustrate how to draw a box on a map and how to query that box.
