Application development with the Webapp SDK
===========================================

This tutorial will discuss how to create an application using the OpenGeo Suite Webapp SDK.

The full API documentation for the SDK is available at http://suite.opengeo.org/opengeo-docs/sdk-api/,  and is `included <../../sdk-api>`_ with this documentation bundle.

For more information on the :file:`suite-sdk` script itself, used throughout this tutorial for creating and testing applications, please see the section on :ref:`webapps.sdk`.

The Client SDK is usually bundled with OpenGeo Suite (under the :file:`sdk` subdirectory), but is available separately from http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/solutions-software/software/.
