The CLI tools package contains all the command line tools for OpenGeo Suite:

* :ref:`Boundless SDK <webapps.sdk>`
* PostGIS data conversion utilities such as ``shp2pgsql``
* `GDAL/OGR <http://www.gdal.org/>`_ format translation utilities

      OpenGeo Suite Command Line Tools Installer

#. Work through the installer dialogs accepting the defaults. 

#. The CLI Tools package installs everything into :file:`/usr/local/opengeo`. This directory must be added to the ``PATH``. Add the following line to your ``.profile``::

     export PATH=/usr/local/opengeo/bin:$PATH

   .. note:: Alternatively you can run the :file:`/usr/local/opengeo/bin/opengeo-clitools-doctor` utility which will create symlinks for all the tools into :file:`/usr/local/bin`. Use this method with caution as it may conflict with different versions of the same tools already installed on the system.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PostGIS Utilities package contains utility applications for working with 
PostGIS and PostgreSQL:

* **pgAdmin** - A database manager for PostgreSQL
* **pgShapeLoader** - A graphical Shapefile loader/dumper

Double-click to run the applications.
