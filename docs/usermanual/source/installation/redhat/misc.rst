Working with OpenGeo Suite for Red Hat Linux
============================================

This document contains information about various tasks specific to OpenGeo Suite for Red Hat-based Linux distributions. 

Starting and stopping OpenGeo services
--------------------------------------

OpenGeo Suite is comprised of two main services:

#. The `Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_ web server that contains all the OpenGeo web applications such as GeoServer, GeoWebCache, and GeoExplorer. 

#. The `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database server with the PostGIS spatial extensions. 

On Red Hat based distributions the :command:`service` command is used to control the services. 

Controlling the Tomcat service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start/stop/restart the Tomcat service:

  .. code-block:: bash
 
     service tomcat start|stop|restart

.. note:: Depending on the distribution and version the service name may be one of "tomcat", "tomcat5", or "tomcat6". Use the :command:`service` command to determine which one is installed:

  .. code-block:: bash

     service --status-all | grep tomcat

Controlling the PostgreSQL service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before PostgreSQL service can be started it must first be initialized:

  .. code-block:: bash

     service postgresql-9.3 initdb

To start/stop/restart the PostgreSQL service:

  .. code-block:: bash
 
     service postgresql-9.3 start|stop|restart

Service port configuration
--------------------------

The Jetty and PostgreSQL services run on ports **8080** and **5432** respectively. These ports can often conflict with existing services on the systemk, in which case the ports must be changed. 

Changing the Tomcat port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the Tomcat port:

#. Edit the file :file:`/etc/tomcat/server.xml`. 

   .. note:: Depending on the distribution and version replace "tomcat" with "tomcat5" or "tomact6" accordingly. Use the :command:`service` command to determine which one is installed:

      .. code-block:: bash

         service --status-all | grep tomcat

#. Search for "8080" (around line 75) and change the ``port`` attribute to the desired value.

#. Restart tomcat. 

   .. code-block:: bash

        service tomcat restart

Changing the PostgreSQL port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the PostgreSQL port:

#. Edit the file :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/postgresql.conf`.

#. Search or the ``port`` property (around line 63), uncomment and change it to the desired value.

#. Restart PostgreSQL.

   .. code-block:: bash

       service postgresql-9.3 restart

GeoServer Data Directory
------------------------

The *GeoServer Data Directory* is the location on the file system where GeoServer
stores all of its configuration, and optionally data. When working with GeoServer
it is often necessary to know where this directory is. It is located at 
:file:`/var/lib/opengeo/geoserver`. 

You may wish to change this location to an alternate location, perhaps to use an 
existing GeoServer configuration. To do so:

#. Edit the file :file:`/usr/share/opengeo/geoserver/WEB-INF/web.xml`.
#. Search for ``GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR`` and change its value accordingly.
#. Restart Tomcat.

PostgreSQL Configuration
------------------------

PostgreSQL configuration is controlled within the ``postgresql.conf`` file. This
file is located at :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/postgresql.conf`. 

You will want to ensure you can connect to the database, and that you have a user to 
work with. Please see the section on :ref:`dataadmin.pgGettingStarted.firstconnect`.
