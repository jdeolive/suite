Once this extension is added, GeoServer will show GeoPackage as one of its available data sources when adding a new store.


.. _intro.extensions.grib:

GRIB
----

The GRIB extension adds support for GeoServer to publish data in `GRIB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB>`_ format. GRIB is a data format commonly used in meteorology to store weather data, both historical and predicted. This version includes support for reading data in GRIB 1 and GRIB 2 formats.


.. _intro.extensions.inspire:

-------

The INSPIRE extension provides additional metadata information for WMS and WFS services as required by the European Commission's `INSPIRE directive <http://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__.

For information on configuring WMS and WFS services, please see the `GeoServer INSPIRE documentation <../geoserver/extensions/inspire/>`_.


.. _intro.extensions.jdbcconfig:

JDBCConfig
----------

The JDBCConfig module enhances the scalability performance of the GeoServer catalog, by externalizing the storage of the catalog configuration objects (such as workspaces, stores, layers) to a database, rather than using XML files in the GeoServer data directory.


.. _intro.extensions.jdbcstore:

JDBCStore
---------

JDBCStore is an *experimental* extension that allows efficient sharing of configuration data in a clustered deployment of GeoServer. It allows externalizing the storage of all configuration to a database, rather than using the default file-based data directory.


.. _intro.extensions.jp2k:

JPEG 2000
---------

The JPEG 2000 extension adds the ability for GeoServer to publish data from `JPEG 2000 <https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/index.html>`_ sources. This image format utilizes wavelet compression for more efficient storage. Once this extension is added, GeoServer will show JPEG 2000 ("JP2K") as one of its available data sources when adding a new store.

.. _intro.extensions.mbtiles:

MBTiles
-------

.. note:: This extension also install the WPS extension.

The MBTiles extension add the ability for GeoServer to publish data saved in `MBTiles <https://www.mapbox.com/help/an-open-platform/#mbtiles>`_ format, which is an efficient format for storing millions of tiles in a single SQLite database.

.. _intro.extensions.mongodb:

MongoDB
-------

The MongoDB extension adds the ability for GeoServer to publish data from `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_ sources. Once this extension is added, GeoServer will show MongoDB as one of its available data sources when adding a new store.

For more information on using MongoDB, see the section on :ref:`dataadmin.mongodb`.

.. note:: This extension will only work when connecting to MongoDB databases at version 2.4 and above.


.. _intro.extensions.netcdf:
