Setting up the clustering extension
===================================

Upon installation of the clustering extension, GeoServer will still be using the original file-based data directory. In order to make use of the clustering extension, some configuration files will need to be edited and GeoServer restarted.

.. note:: Configuration of the clustering extension, as it involves changes to the data directory, must be done through configuration files. It cannot be done through the UI. It is also not possible to use the REST API to configure the clustering extension.

The following process will detail how to set up an initial cluster. The specific network details will change depending on your system.

.. note:: This setup assumes that a load balancer (such as `HAProxy <http://haproxy.1wt.eu/>`_ will be employed in front of GeoServer. The details of the configuration of the load balancer are beyond the scope of this documentation.

Database setup
--------------

.. warning:: Setting up a database for the data directory is a **one-way process**. It is not currently possible to export the configuration back to a file-based data directory.

To set up the shared database that will contain the data directory:

#. Create a database, as well as a role able to create tables in that database. PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and H2 are all supported.

#. Install GeoServer, if it is not already installed, but make sure it is not running. The data directory associated with this instance will be the one that is ingested into the database.

   .. warning:: Make sure you have set the data directory to be external to the GeoServer installation, in a shared location that all GeoServer instances will be able to access.

#. Open the file :file:`<data_dir>/jdbcconfig/jdbcconfig.properties` in a text editor, where ``<data_dir>`` is the location of the current file-based data directory.

#. Replace the lines::

     initdb=false
     import=false

   with the lines::

     initdb=true
     import=true
     
#. Set the connection information for the database created earlier. The specifics of these parameters will depend on the choice of database used, as well as whether you are using JNDI. See the :ref:`sysadmin.clustering.params` for more details on the options available.

#. Save and close this file.

Broadcasting setup
------------------

#. Open the file :file:`<data_dir>/cluster/cluster.properties` in a text editor.

#. Replace the lines::

     sync_mode=reload
     sync_delay=5

   with the lines::

     sync_mode=event
     sync_delay=0

#. Save and close this file.

Verification
------------

#. Start GeoServer and log in as an administrator to the web interface.

#. If clustering extension is working, you will see two messages on the Welcome page: one about JDBCConfig and the other about clustering.

   .. todo:: Screenshot needed.

#. Confirm that the JDBC message lists the correct JDBC URL. Also confirm that the layers, stores, and other catalog objects have been imported correctly by viewing the list and them in the Layer Preview.

Other nodes
-----------

To configure the other GeoServer nodes, perform the following steps on each:

#. Install GeoServer with the clustering extension. Make sure that it is responding on the same subnet as the initial GeoServer.

   .. note:: Alternately, you can convert the edited GeoServer instance to a WAR and then deploy it.

#. Point the new GeoServer instance to the shared data directory.

#. Restart the new GeoServer. Verify that the extension is working properly and that the node is reading the shared data directory.

Session sharing
---------------

*(Optional but recommended)* HTTP session sharing is not enabled by default. To enable session sharing:

#. Open the file :file:`<webapps>/geoserver/WEB-INF/web.xml` in a text editor.

#. Add this block of text as the first ``filter`` in the file.

   .. warning:: The order is very important here. This must come first. 

   .. code-block:: xml

      <filter>
        <filter-name>hazelcast</filter-name>
        <filter-class>org.geoserver.cluster.hazelcast.web.HzSessionShareFilter</filter-class>
      </filter>

#. Add the following block of text as the very first ``filter-mapping`` in the file.

   .. warning:: Again, the order is very important.

   .. code-block:: xml

      <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>hazelcast</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
      </filter-mapping>

#. Add the following block of text in the ``listener`` section. The order is not important here.

   .. code-block:: xml

    <!-- hazelcast session listener -->
    <listener>
      <listener-class>org.geoserver.cluster.hazelcast.web.HzSessionShareListener</listener-class>
    </listener>

#. Restart GeoServer.

Repeat this for each GeoServer in the cluster.

Log separation
--------------

By default, a cluster will end up collecting all the log output from all the nodes into a single file without indicating which message came from which node.

If this is not desired, you can split the logs into files distinct to each node. This property can be set via the standard methods of a JVM system variable, environment variable, or servlet context parameter.

The variable to set is called ``GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION``::

  GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION=[log_location]

Or, as set in :file:`web.xml`:

.. code-block:: xml

   <context-param>
     <param-name>GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION</param-name>
     <param-value>[log_location]</param-value>
   </context-param> 

For example, on GeoServer node #1, you could set the following variable::

  GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION=logs/geoserver_node1.log

For node #2::

  GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION=logs/geoserver_node2.log

This way, each node will have its own log in the shared data directory, making administration and troubleshooting easier.

Final verification
------------------

To verify that the cluster is set up correctly, perform the following steps:

#. If you enabled session sharing, log in to GeoServer through the load balancer, shut down the node that handled the login request, then make subsequent requests and verify that you are still logged in.

#. On the first instance, view a layer (through the Layer Preview).

#. On the second instance, make a change to the layer, such as one that will affect its visualization or metadata (Title or Abstract). Save this change.

#. Verify that the change has propagated back to the first instance.

   .. note:: Perform this step quickly so as to ensure that it is the clustering extension that is working as expected, and not just as a result of cache expiration.

Repeat these steps for other instances until all nodes in the cluster have been tested against one other node.
