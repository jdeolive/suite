Administration on Red Hat
=========================

This document contains information about various tasks specific to Boundless Suite for Red Hat Linux-based systems. For more details, please see the :ref:`sysadmin` section.

Starting and stopping Boundless Suite services
----------------------------------------------

Boundless Suite is comprised of two main services:

#. The `Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_ web server that contains all the web applications such as GeoServer and GeoWebCache. 

#. The `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database server with the PostGIS spatial extensions.

.. note:: The Tomcat service used by Boundless Suite is pulled in from standard repository sources, and is not specific to Boundless Suite.

Controlling the Tomcat service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start|stop|restart the Tomcat service:

.. code-block:: bash
 
   service tomcat8 start|stop|restart

Other options in addition to the above are ``try-restart``, ``force-restart``, and ``status``.

.. note:: Depending on the distribution and version the service name may be one of "tomcat", "tomcat8", or "tomcat9". Use the :command:`service` command to determine which one is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   service --status-all | grep tomcat

Controlling the PostgreSQL service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before PostgreSQL service can be started it must first be initialized:

.. code-block:: bash

   service postgresql-9.3 initdb

To start|stop|restart the PostgreSQL service:

.. code-block:: bash
 
   service postgresql-9.3 start|stop|restart

Service port configuration
--------------------------

The Tomcat and PostgreSQL services run on ports **8080** and **5432** respectively. These ports can often conflict with existing services on the system, in which case the ports must be changed. 

Changing the Tomcat port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the Tomcat port:

#. Edit the file :file:`/etc/tomcat8/conf/server.xml`. 

#. Search for the following line::

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"

#. Change the port value.

#. Restart Tomcat.

Changing the PostgreSQL port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the PostgreSQL port:

#. Edit the file :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/postgresql.conf`.

#. Search or the ``port`` property (around line 63), uncomment and change it to the desired value.

#. Restart PostgreSQL.

Working with Tomcat
-------------------

Changing the Tomcat Java
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to use the Oracle Java 8 JRE (rather than the OpenJDK 8 installed by default):

#. Download and install Oracle Java 8 JRE.

#. Open :file:`/etc/tomcat8/conf/tomcat8.conf` and update the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable.

      export $JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.8.0_77

   .. note:: Make sure the line is uncommented (does not start with ``#``).

#. Save and close the file.

#. Restart Tomcat.

Adding other system parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add other system or application-specific parameters that will be picked up upon restart.

* To provide an environmental variable, open :file:`/etc/tomcat8/tomcat8.conf` in a text editor, add the desired parameters to the bottom of the file, such as ``GDAL_DATA=/usr/share/gdal``.
   
* System properties are read in from the files in :file:`/etc/tomcat8/suite-opts/`. So you could create a text file named :file:`memory` and populate it with ``-Xmx2G``. See the section on :ref:`sysadmin.startup`.

* Context Parameters are application-specific, and are read in from the files in :file:`/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/`. All parameters should be under the top-level ``<Context>`` tag. For example, the GeoServer data directory context parameter in :file:`/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/geoserver.xml` looks like this:

  .. code-block:: xml

     <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR" 
          value="/var/opt/boundless/suite/geoserver/data" override="false"/>

After making any changes, be sure to restart Tomcat.

Working with GeoServer
----------------------

GeoServer data directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **GeoServer data directory** is the location on the file system where GeoServer stores all of its configuration, and (optionally) file-based data. By default, this directory is located at: :file:`/var/opt/boundless/suite/geoserver/data`. 

To point GeoServer to an alternate location:

#. Edit the file :file:`/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/geoserver.xml`.

   Define ``GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR`` with an appropriate value accordingly.
   
   .. code-block:: xml
      
      <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR" 
        value="/var/opt/boundless/suite/geoserver/data" override="false"/>

#. Restart Tomcat.

Enabling spatial reference systems with Imperial units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A fix is available for spatial reference systems measured in Imperial units (feet). This setting is recommended for all users, and strongly recommended for those working with **US State Plane** projections measured in feet.

To enable this fix:

#. Add a system properties definition to the :file:`/etc/tomcat8/suite-opts/` folder.

#. Create the file :file:`/etc/tomcat8/suite-opts/units`::
      
      -Dorg.geotoools.render.lite.scale.unitCompensation=true

#. Restart Tomcat.

Update GeoJSON output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
GeoServer GeoJSON output is now provided in x/y/z order as required by the specification. In addition, the ``crs``  output has changed to support full URN representation of spatial reference systems::

      "crs": {
         "type": "name",
         "properties": {
            "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"
         }
      }

.. note::

   Previously, the output was::

         "crs": {
            "type": "EPSG",
            "properties": {
               "code": "4326"
            }
         }
   
To restore the previous ``crs`` representation for compatibility reasons (especially when working with OpenLayers 3):

#. Navigate to :file:`/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/` and edit the file :file:`geoserver.xml`.

#. Add the following context parameter to :file:`geoserver.xml`:

   .. code-block:: xml

     <Parameter name="GEOSERVER_GEOJSON_LEGACY_CRS" value="true" override="false"/>

#. Restart Tomcat.

PostgreSQL configuration
------------------------

PostgreSQL configuration is controlled within the ``postgresql.conf`` file. This file is located at :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/postgresql.conf`. 

You will want to ensure that you can connect to the database. Please see the section on :ref:`dataadmin.pgGettingStarted.firstconnect` to set this up.
