Installing vector tiles support
===============================

Installing
----------

Vector tiles support isn't enabled by default, so it must be separately installed through an extension.

.. include:: ../include/ext_install_links.txt

Verifying installation
----------------------

.. include:: ../../install/include/ext/vectortiles_verify.txt

For more information on adding a store and publishing layers, please see the :ref:`dataadmin.vectortiles.tutorial`.
