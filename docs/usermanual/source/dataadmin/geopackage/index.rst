.. todo:: Say more about what this is.

Installing GeoPackage support
-----------------------------

GeoPackage support isn't enabled by default, so it must be separately installed through an extension.

.. include:: ../include/ext_install_links.txt

Verifying installation
----------------------

.. include:: ../../install/include/ext/geopackage_verify.txt

For more information on GeoPackage, please see the `GeoServer documentation for GeoPackage <../../geoserver/community/geopkg/>`_.
