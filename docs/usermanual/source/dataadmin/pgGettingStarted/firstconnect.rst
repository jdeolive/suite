Connecting to PostgreSQL on Linux for the first time
====================================================

.. note:: This section uses the command line utility ``psql`` and optionally the graphical utility ``pgAdmin``.  ``psql`` is included with the Boundless Suite PostgreSQL package. ``pgAdmin`` is provided as part of Boundless Desktop.

on Linux, both on Ubuntu and Red Hat-based systems, the default PostgreSQL configuration has connections turned off for the ``postgres`` user by default.

So after install of Boundless Suite, if you try to connect to PostgreSQL via the :command:`psql` command-line utility or through :command:`pgAdmin`, you will get the following connection error::

  psql: FATAL:  peer authentication failed for user "postgres"

There are two steps to allow connections to PostgreSQL:

* Set a password for the ``postgres`` user
* Allow local connections to PostgreSQL

For more information, please see the `Ubuntu documentation on PostgreSQL <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL>`_.

Setting a password for the ``postgres`` user
--------------------------------------------

On Linux systems, there is no default password set.

To set the default password:

#. Run the :command:`psql` command from the ``postgres`` user account:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo -u postgres psql postgres

#. Set the password:

   .. code-block:: console

      \password postgres

#. Enter a password.

#. Close :command:`psql`.

   .. code-block:: console

      \q

Allowing local connections
--------------------------

The file :file:`pg_hba.conf` governs the basic constraints underlying connection to PostgreSQL. By default, these settings are very conservative. Specifically, local connections are not allowed for the ``postgres`` user.

To allow this:

#. As a super user, open :file:`/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf` (Ubuntu) or :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_hba.conf` (Red Hat) in a text editor.

#. Scroll down to the line that describes local socket connections. It may look like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      local   all             all                                      peer

#. Change the ``peer`` method to ``md5``.

   .. note:: For more information on the various options, please see the `PostgreSQL documentation on pg_hba.conf <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>`_. 

#. To allow connections using :command:`pgAdmin`, find the line that describes local loopback connections over IPv6:

   .. code-block:: console

      host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident

#. Change the ``ident`` method to ``md5``.

#. Save and close the file.

#. Restart PostgreSQL:

   * Ubuntu:

     .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql restart  

   * Red Hat:

     .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql-9.3 restart 

#. To test your connection using :command:`psql`, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      psql -U postgres -W

   and enter your password when prompted. You should be able to access the :command:`psql` console.

#. To test your connection using :command:`pgAdmin`, connect to the database at localhost:5432 using the user name ``postgres`` and the password supplied.

   .. figure:: img/firstconnect_pgadmin_ubuntu.png

      Testing the connection in pgAdmin

If you encounter errors, make sure that the ``postgres`` password is set correctly, and that the correct line was edited in :file:`pg_hba.conf`, as many look alike.

Allowing remote connections
---------------------------

Often the system running ``psql`` will be different from the system running the database. This is especially true if you want to run :command:`pgAdmin` from your system.

In order to allow connections from remote systems, some slightly different configuration will be necessary.

The details are similar to that of allowing local connections, with some slight differences.

#. As a super user, open :file:`/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf` (Ubuntu) or :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_hba.conf` (Red Hat) in a text editor.

#. Scroll down to the line that describes local socket connections. It may look like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      local   all             all                                      peer

#. Change to:

   .. code-block:: console

      host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               trust

   .. warning:: This is a potential security risk, and you may wish to customize this further. For more information on the various options, please see the `PostgreSQL documentation on pg_hba.conf <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>`_. 

#. Save and close the file.

#. In the same directory, open :file:`postgresql.conf`.

#. Under the section on :guilabel:`Connection Settings`, add or replace the line that starts with ``listen_addresses`` to respond to all requests:

   .. code-block:: console

      listen_addresses = '*'

   .. note:: Make sure the line is uncommented.

#. Save and close the file.

#. Restart PostgreSQL:

   * Ubuntu:

     .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql restart  

   * Red Hat:

     .. code-block:: console

        sudo service postgresql-9.3 restart 

#. To test your connection using :command:`pgAdmin`, connect to the database at the IP address or host name of the system that hosts the database. Enter the user name ``postgres`` and the password supplied.

   .. note:: Make sure that port 5432 is open on this system.
