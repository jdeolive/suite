Activating the Point Cloud extension
------------------------------------

The Point Cloud extension works like any other extension in PostgreSQL. It is applied to a given database via the ``CREATE EXTENSION`` SQL command.

#. Create/connect to a database (either through the command line or through :command:`pgAdmin`.)

#. Run the following command::

     CREATE EXTENSION pointcloud

If the command is successful, the database now has the Point Cloud extension activated.
